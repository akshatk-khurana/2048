# 2048
My remake of the original 2048 game, it mimics most of its functionality and only fails to match up to the small animations the original game has.

# Usage
Go to [this](https://akshatk-khurana.github.io/2048/) website (hosted by Github pages) to play it! Use the arrows keys to move up/down/left/right and the 'New Game' button to start a new game. Your current score and high score will be displayed in the two brown boxes on the top.
